# Jobber

### A unique, one of a kind Flask app. 
#### I had to make a job application portal, for my college project. But I refused to make a vanilla job portal and decided to use it to solve a problem. So, whenever a company posts a job opening, many people apply to it, but only one of them gets it. So, I created a social media for CVs, where people will post their CVs and recruiters can like on CVs that they dont hire(only recruiters, because why would a candidate like a competitor's CV). Now the app will show those CVs at the top of the news feed with the highest number of likes for other recruiters looking to hire people.
